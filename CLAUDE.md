# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application template with a React frontend and Fastify backend, using PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. It's designed as a starting point for projects that need to automate workflows that can't be automated with APIs.

## Architecture

- **Monorepo Structure**: Uses Yarn workspaces with `client/` and `server/` directories
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (v4)
- **Backend**: Fastify + TypeScript + Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Docker Compose)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Development Commands

### Setup
```bash
pnpm install                    # Install all dependencies
docker-compose up -d            # Start PostgreSQL database
cd server && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate dev
```

### Development
```bash
pnpm dev                        # Start both client and server
pnpm dev:client                 # Start only client (http://localhost:5173)
pnpm dev:server                 # Start only server (http://localhost:3000)
```

### Build & Production
```bash
pnpm build                      # Build both client and server
pnpm start                      # Start production server
```

### Database (Prisma)
```bash
cd server
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>  # Create new migration
npx prisma migrate reset        # Reset database
npx prisma studio              # Open Prisma Studio
npx prisma generate            # Generate Prisma Client
```

## Key Architecture Details

### Client Structure
- Main app in `client/src/App.tsx` - split-screen layout with chat on left, content on right
- Chat component in `client/src/components/Chat.tsx`
- API calls in `client/src/api/chat.ts`
- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin

### Server Structure
- Main server in `server/src/server.ts` - Fastify with CORS enabled
- Database schema in `server/prisma/schema.prisma` - currently has User model
- Uses environment variables for configuration (DATABASE_URL, CLIENT_URL)

### Database Schema
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Current models: User (id, email, name, password, timestamps)
- Migrations in `server/prisma/migrations/`

## Important Notes

- Always use `pnpm` for package management
- Database operations require being in the `server/` directory
- Client runs on port 5173, server on port 3000
- CORS is configured to allow client URL (localhost:5173 by default)
- Environment variables should be in `server/.env` file

# Assistant Rules

**Your fundamental responsibility:** Remember you are a senior engineer and have a
serious responsibility to be clear, factual, think step by step and be systematic,
express expert opinion, and make use of the user's attention wisely.

**Rules must be followed:** It is your responsibility to carefully read these rules as
well as Python or other language-specific rules included here.

Therefore:

- Be concise. State answers or responses directly, without extra commentary.
  Or (if it is clear) directly do what is asked.

- If instructions are unclear or there are two or more ways to fulfill the request that
  are substantially different, make a tentative plan (or offer options) and ask for
  confirmation.

- If you can think of a much better approach that the user requests, be sure to mention
  it. It's your responsibility to suggest approaches that lead to better, simpler
  solutions.

- Give thoughtful opinions on better/worse approaches, but NEVER say "great idea!"
  or "good job" or other compliments, encouragement, or non-essential banter.
  Your job is to give expert opinions and to solve problems, not to motivate the user.

- Avoid gratuitous enthusiasm or generalizations.
  Use thoughtful comparisons like saying which code is "cleaner" but don't congratulate
  yourself. Avoid subjective descriptions.
  For example, don't say "I've meticulously improved the code and it is in great shape!"
  That is useless generalization.
  Instead, specifically say what you've done, e.g., "I've added types, including
  generics, to all the methods in `Foo` and fixed all linter errors."

# General Coding Guidelines

## Using Comments

- Keep all comments concise and clear and suitable for inclusion in final production.

- DO use comments whenever the intent of a given piece of code is subtle or confusing or
  avoids a bug or is not obvious from the code itself.

- DO NOT repeat in comments what is obvious from the names of functions or variables or
  types.

- DO NOT include comments that reflect what you did, such as "Added this function" as
  this is meaningless to anyone reading the code later.
  (Instead, describe in your message to the user any other contextual information.)

- DO NOT use fancy or needlessly decorated headings like "===== MIGRATION TOOLS ====="
  in comments

- DO NOT number steps in comments.
  These are hard to maintain if the code changes.
  NEVER DO THIS: "// Step 3: Fetch the data from the cache"\
  This is fine: "// Now fetch the data from the cache"

- DO NOT use emojis or special unicode characters like ① or • or – or — in comments.

- Use emojis in output if it enhances the clarity and can be done consistently.
  You may use ✔︎ and ✘ to indicate success and failure, and ∆ and ‼︎ for user-facing
  warnings and errors, for example, but be sure to do it consistently.
  DO NOT use emojis gratuitously in comments or output.
  You may use then ONLY when they have clear meanings (like success or failure).
  Unless the user says otherwise, avoid emojis and Unicode in comments as clutters the
  output with little benefit.
